OpenDroids is a mission-driven robotics company focused on **open-source, AI-powered robots** that transform everyday life and industry.  
Our motto is **“Skillnet > Skynet”**, reflecting our belief that community-driven (“skillnet”) development can prevent closed, monopolistic AI (“Skynet”).  

We build advanced domestic and commercial robots – such as our dual-arm **R2D3** and single-arm **R1D1** platforms – that can fold laundry, wash dishes, serve customers, and more. Each robot is built on a **customizable, open-source platform**, so developers and partners can extend its capabilities rather than being locked into proprietary systems.

## 🚀 What We Do

- **AI-Driven Robotics** – Robots powered by machine learning, real-time perception, and intelligent control.  
- **Customizable Platforms** – Open-source, ROS 2-based systems that anyone can extend.  
- **Industry Focus** – From homes to healthcare, hospitality, and manufacturing.  
- **End-to-End Solutions** – Hardware, sensors, perception, and control software designed together.
